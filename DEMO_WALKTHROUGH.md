## Part 1: Infrastructure Setup (5 minutes)

### Open Snowsight SQL Worksheet

1. Navigate to **Snowsight** → **Worksheets** → **+ Worksheet**
2. Name the worksheet: `Demo Canvas Demo Setup`

### Run Infrastructure Script

```sql
-- Copy and paste from: sql/01_setup_infrastructure.sql
-- This creates:
--   ✓ DEMO_CANVAS_DB database
--   ✓ RAW, CURATED, COMPUTE, AUDIT schemas
--   ✓ Warehouses (DEMO_INGESTION_WH, DEMO_TRANSFORM_WH, DEMO_TASK_WH)
--   ✓ Image repository for containers
--   ✓ Compute pool for SPCS
```

### Verify Setup

```sql
SHOW DATABASES LIKE 'DEMO_CANVAS_DB';
SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE DEMO_CANVAS_DB;
SHOW WAREHOUSES LIKE 'DEMO_%';
SHOW COMPUTE POOLS LIKE 'DEMO_%';

-- Get your image repository URL (needed for CI/CD)
SHOW IMAGE REPOSITORIES IN SCHEMA DEMO_CANVAS_DB.COMPUTE;
```

**💡 Demo Talking Point:** "We've created a complete data platform infrastructure including separate schemas for raw landing data, curated analytics, and container compute resources."

---

## Part 2: Canvas Data Model (3 minutes)

### Run Data Model Script

```sql
-- Copy and paste from: sql/02_canvas_data_model.sql
-- This creates the Canvas LMS data model:
--   ✓ RAW layer tables (VARIANT storage)
--   ✓ Dimension tables (DIM_STUDENTS, DIM_COURSES, DIM_ASSIGNMENTS)
--   ✓ Fact tables (FACT_ENROLLMENTS, FACT_SUBMISSIONS, FACT_ACTIVITY_LOGS)
--   ✓ Aggregation tables for analytics
--   ✓ Streams for change data capture
```

### Explore the Data Model

```sql
-- View all tables
SELECT table_schema, table_name, row_count
FROM DEMO_CANVAS_DB.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
WHERE table_type = 'BASE TABLE'
ORDER BY table_schema, table_name;

-- View streams
SHOW STREAMS IN DATABASE DEMO_CANVAS_DB;
```

**💡 Demo Talking Point:** "This medallion architecture separates raw ingestion from curated analytics, with streams enabling efficient change data capture."

---

## Part 3: Synthetic Data Generation (5 minutes)

### Deploy Data Generator

```sql
-- Copy and paste from: sql/03_dummy_data_generator.sql
-- This creates stored procedures for generating realistic Canvas data
```

### Generate Sample Data

```sql
USE DATABASE DEMO_CANVAS_DB;
USE SCHEMA RAW;
USE WAREHOUSE DEMO_TASK_WH;

-- Generate a complete dataset
CALL GENERATE_COMPLETE_CANVAS_DATASET(
    100,   -- 100 students
    20,    -- 20 courses
    5,     -- 5 enrollments per student
    15,    -- 15 assignments per course
    25     -- 25 activity logs per enrollment
);

-- Or generate individually:
-- CALL GENERATE_DUMMY_STUDENTS(50);
-- CALL GENERATE_DUMMY_COURSES(10);
```

### Verify Generated Data

```sql
-- Check record counts
SELECT 'RAW_STUDENTS' AS table_name, COUNT(*) AS record_count FROM RAW_STUDENTS
UNION ALL
SELECT 'RAW_COURSES', COUNT(*) FROM RAW_COURSES
UNION ALL
SELECT 'RAW_ENROLLMENTS', COUNT(*) FROM RAW_ENROLLMENTS
UNION ALL
SELECT 'RAW_ASSIGNMENTS', COUNT(*) FROM RAW_ASSIGNMENTS
UNION ALL
SELECT 'RAW_SUBMISSIONS', COUNT(*) FROM RAW_SUBMISSIONS
UNION ALL
SELECT 'RAW_ACTIVITY_LOGS', COUNT(*) FROM RAW_ACTIVITY_LOGS;

-- Preview student data
SELECT 
    payload:student_id::VARCHAR AS student_id,
    payload:first_name::VARCHAR AS first_name,
    payload:last_name::VARCHAR AS last_name,
    payload:major::VARCHAR AS major,
    payload:gpa::NUMBER(3,2) AS gpa
FROM RAW_STUDENTS
LIMIT 10;
```

**💡 Demo Talking Point:** "Using Python UDFs with Faker, we generate realistic student data that mimics actual Canvas LMS exports."

---

## Part 4: Scheduled Tasks (3 minutes)

### Deploy Tasks

```sql
-- Copy and paste from: sql/04_scheduled_task.sql
-- This creates:
--   ✓ TASK_GENERATE_DUMMY_DATA (simulates incoming data)
--   ✓ TASK_PROCESS_RAW_STUDENTS (stream-based processing)
--   ✓ TASK_TRIGGER_CONTAINER_ETL (container orchestration)
--   ✓ TASK_REFRESH_AGGREGATIONS (analytics updates)
```

### View Task DAG

```sql
-- Show all tasks
SHOW TASKS IN SCHEMA DEMO_CANVAS_DB.RAW;

-- View task dependencies
SELECT name, warehouse, schedule, predecessors, state
FROM TABLE(INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TASK_DEPENDENTS(
    TASK_NAME => 'DEMO_CANVAS_DB.RAW.TASK_GENERATE_DUMMY_DATA',
    RECURSIVE => TRUE
));
```

### Enable Tasks (Optional for Demo)

```sql
-- Start the task pipeline
ALTER TASK TASK_GENERATE_DUMMY_DATA RESUME;

-- Check task history
SELECT *
FROM TABLE(INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TASK_HISTORY())
WHERE DATABASE_NAME = 'DEMO_CANVAS_DB'
ORDER BY SCHEDULED_TIME DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**💡 Demo Talking Point:** "Snowflake Tasks create a DAG-based orchestration layer, automatically processing new data when streams detect changes."
